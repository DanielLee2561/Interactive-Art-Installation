# Interactive Art Installation (Max/Unity/C#)	Jan 2024 - May 2024
Developed software for interactive video and motion control at the 2024 UBC Bang! Festival.
Deployed particle systems in Unity to generate ripples on water. Applied sensors with UDP networking to control position and strength by receiving motion data from ZigSim.
Designed a custom shader for a day-night cycle skybox. This entailed modelling a finite state machine in C#, using lerp to interpolate cubemaps, and applying rotation to simulate movement.
